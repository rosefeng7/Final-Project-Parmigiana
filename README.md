In this project, we focused on analyzing the effect of different clothing colors on AWS Rekognition. 

If you are interested in replicating our project, please take a look at this: https://share-file-data.s3.amazonaws.com/QTM_350_Final_Project+(1).html, where we thoroughly explained our data extraction, data analysis, and data visualization processes. 

The two datasets we used are uploaded here, and the jupyter notebooks for data extraction, data analysis, and data visualization are also avaiable here.
